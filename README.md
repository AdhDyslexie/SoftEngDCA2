# SoftEngDC Assignment 2


### Task

Create a project assign251_2 using the Maven project layout, and within this project, create a project that implements custom appender and layout objects for Log4j. For this, you will need to create an appender and layout that work with the other Log4j objects (i.e., implementing relevant Log4j abstract classes or interfaces), test them and run profiling tools on them to gauge their correctness and efficiency. Note, there is no main class for this project, it will be run via your tests from sections 3 and 4. You may want to consider a test-driven development methodology, where your first step is to start with section 3 and work backwards. This will allow you to check that your classes are working correctly as you go.
